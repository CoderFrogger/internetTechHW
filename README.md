This is my Homework for Internet Technologies. I have no idea what I'm doing

#php
To make this work I suggest getting xampp and then taking the contents of the php folder
(there's only api in there) and putting it in xampp's htdocs. Now run Apache and phpMyAdmin

##mysql
I made a db called react and gave it a table called "users"
added columns for:
  id(PK, auto incremented)
  username
  email
  password

##safety of this app
HAH!

#REACT
If you're all set up open up a cmd of some sort run `npm i` and `npm run dev`
that should open up the thingamajig, go to your favorite browser et volia! Have fun
